  "Game engine.

A bot is a function of [game -> domino].

The returned domino must be horizontal; that is, the column coordinates differ
by 1 but the row coordinates are equal. That is, every player plays
horizontal, and sees the other player as playing vertical. (The game engine
gives the second player a transposed view of the board.)"

If a bot returns an invalid move or an invalid domino or simply throws
an exception, the bot will lose that game."
