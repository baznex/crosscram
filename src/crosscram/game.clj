## Terms

In this documentation, \"vector\" means any indexed, sequential collection.

## Boards

A board is a 2-dimensional matrix. Create with #'board, access with
#'location-empty?

A cell on the board is addressed by a vector of [row column], zero-indexed.
These may also be called coordinates or squares.

## Dominoes

A domino is a vector of two squares: [[r0 c0] [r1 c1]].
The order of the squares in a vector is not important, but the game engine
will not alter it.

## Moves

A move is simply a domino. A \"valid move\" is in reference to a board,
whereas a domino may be judged valid or not without reference to anything.

## History

A game history is a vector of events. An event is a map of :type (:move,
:invalid-move, :player-error, :cant-move) and possibly other keys
depending on :type. A :move is a valid move that can be placed on the current
board; an :invalid-move is a valid domino that cannot be played on this board,
including mis-oriented dominoes. A :player-error is a throw or a returned value
that is not a domino. :cant-move occurs when the game is over -- the player
has not been consulted. A completed game's history ends with a non-:move event.

* :player-id - 0 or 1
* :duration - bot's elapsed time (nanoseconds), for all but :cant-move
* :move - played domino (canonicalized), for :move or :invalid-move
* :error - with :player-error, the thrown error (if applicable)
* :return - with :player-error, the returned value (if applicable)

The index of each event is called its ordinal; the event at index 0 was
the first event. A new game will have an empty history vector.

The board contains an alternate view of history. Each cell contains either
the ordinal (from the history vector) of the move that covered that square,
or nil if the square is open. Future work may add additional cell value types,
but open squares will remain logical-false for the foreseeable future.

## Gamestate

A gamestate value (which is provided to the bot) is a map of:
:board - a board value, as defined above
:dims - a vector of [row-count column-count]
:history - a history value, as defined above
:player-id - 0 or 1, indicating which player's view this is
:over? - indicates the game is over and the last history event records this

This will sometimes simply be called a game value.")

;; Implementation details

;; In 2 dimensions:
;; - A board is a 2-level nesting of vectors. The top-level vector contains
;;   the row vectors.
;; - The order of the squares in a domino is canonically in low to high
;;   order along the x axis. Bots are allowed to return dominoes in either
;;   order, but some methods may declare a need for canonical order. The
;;   history will contain canonical dominoes.
